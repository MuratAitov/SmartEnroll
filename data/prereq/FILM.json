How have the poetics and politics of the Hollywood film developed over time? Why has the Hollywood film endured over time? What voices have been neglected by Hollywood history? What does Hollywood history have to teach us about our own moment? In exploring these questions, we will draw on film studies, American studies, cognitive science, economics, cultural theory, history, critical race theory, feminist theory, aesthetics, and ethics to develop a comprehensive understanding of what Hollywood has meant and what it means today.",

Du Bois famously described the African-American experience as a kind of “double-consciousness, [a] sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others,” torn between two identities: “an American, a Negro.” This course  reflects this same duality, existing in tension between two simultaneous classes. The first half of the course examines the way that American popular cinema has represented the lives and humanity of black citizens—the “looking at one’s self through the eyes of others” that Du Bois refers to. This portion of the course will consider how the industry of Hollywood—a largely white, straight, and male institution—depicted and shaped the lives of black Americans for the movie-going public. The second half of the course examines how black filmmakers from the earliest moments of American filmmaking to our own moment have used cinema as a form of self-expression and meaning-making. This portion of the course  considers black filmmaking both as a response to historical representations of African-Americans and as a cinematic history separate from a relationship to white America. In combining these two separate intellectual impulses, this course aims to instantiate Du Bois’s “double-consciousness” and do justice both to the need to examine Hollywood cinema’s history of racial injustice and to the desire to explore the rich tableau of black filmmaking in the United States.",

This course seeks to explore many contemporary films (none older than Blade Runner) and the philosophical issues they raise, both by their explicit content and by their implicit content. Metaphysical issues about the mind and body relationship, the nature and extent of free will, and the nature of personal identity will be included. Some epistemological issues having to do with how well we can expect to have access to reality, and what might be among the impediments to the access will also be included. The course generally avoids treating ethical or moral issues, but also takes an interest in the use of the emotions in films, the treatment of violence and human sexuality in films and the nature of comedy in films. Some attention will also be given to film techniques, especially from the point of view of the audience.",
